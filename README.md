# This is a test task.

Welcome to my first React test project with React DevTools! It's designed for tracking tweets and offers the following features:

- Follow Button: Easily switch between "Follow" and "Following" states. The button color and follower count update accordingly.
- Page Refresh Persistence: Even after refreshing, the button retains its state and color, and the follower count remains unchanged.
- Button Reset: Clicking the button again resets it to its initial state. The color reverts, and the follower count decreases by one.
- Tweet Filtering: Enjoy the ability to filter tweets based on different criteria.

The project implements routing with two main routes:

- Home Page: Visit "/" for an engaging home page with customizable styling.
- Tweets Page: Access "/tweets" to explore a dedicated page displaying tweets. A Back button ensures easy navigation to the main page.

Discover the joy of tracking tweets and managing followers in this intuitive project. Let's get started!
